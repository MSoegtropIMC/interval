Prerequisites
-------------

You will need the Coq proof assistant (>= 8.4) with a Reals theory compiled
in. You will need the Flocq library (http://flocq.gforge.inria.fr/) to be
installed too.

The .tar.gz file is distributed with a working set of configure files. They
are not in the git repository though. Consequently, if you are building from
git, you will need autoconf (>= 2.59).


Configuring, compiling and installing
-------------------------------------

Ideally, you should just have to type:

  $ ./configure && ./remake && ./remake install

The environment variable COQC can be passed to the configure script in order
to set the Coq compiler command. The configure script defaults to "coqc".

Option "--libdir=DIR" sets the directory where the compiled library files
should be installed by "./remake install". By default, the target directory
is "`$COQC -where`/user-contrib/Interval".

The files are compiled at a logical location starting with "Interval".
